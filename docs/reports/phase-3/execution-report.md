## Notable observations

- Playwright now boots the Vite dev server with `VITE_ENABLE_MSW=true` and waits for the mock service worker in automation contexts, preventing transient translation 403s.
- The translation registry generator (`scripts/generate-translation-registry.mjs`) remains unchanged during this run; no regeneration was required.
