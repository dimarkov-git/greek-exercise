# Learn Greek development roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development priorities for the Learn Greek application, building on the solid foundation
established in Phases 0-5.

## Current status

### Completed phases (0-5)

✅ **Phase 0** - Environment-aware bootstrap with MSW/DevTools configuration
✅ **Phase 1** - Architecture decomposition and component boundaries
✅ **Phase 2** - Domain layer and exercise system architecture
✅ **Phase 3** - Type-safe i18n with generated translation registry
✅ **Phase 4** - Testing expansion and HTTP fallback policies
✅ **Phase 5** - Coverage governance (93%+ statements/lines/functions)

### Architecture highlights

- **React 19 + TypeScript 5** with strict typing and project references
- **Feature-Sliced Design** with clear module boundaries
- **Generated i18n registry** with deterministic fallbacks
- **Comprehensive testing** (93%+ coverage with Vitest + Playwright)
- **HTTP client** with configurable fallback policies
- **SSR-safe effects** for DOM mutations and state sync

### Current metrics

- **Bundle size:** ~145KB gzipped main bundle
- **Test coverage:** 93%+ statements/lines/functions, 88%+ branches
- **Performance:** LCP < 2s, bundle analysis integrated
- **Accessibility:** WCAG AA compliance with @axe-core/playwright

## Phase 6 - Performance & PWA foundation

### Goals

Optimize performance and lay groundwork for Progressive Web App features.

### Deliverables

- **Route-based code splitting** - Split exercise pages and reduce main bundle
- **Asset optimization** - Image optimization, font preloading, critical CSS
- **Service Worker implementation** - Basic caching strategy for static assets
- **Bundle monitoring** - CI integration with size regression alerts
- **Web App Manifest** - PWA installability with proper icons and metadata

### Technical tasks

- Implement `React.lazy()` for exercise components
- Add `rollup-plugin-visualizer` to CI pipeline
- Configure Workbox for service worker generation
- Optimize Tailwind CSS purging and critical path CSS
- Add bundle size budgets to CI validation

**Timeline:** 4-6 weeks
**Bundle target:** < 120KB main, < 80KB per route

## Phase 7 - Enhanced exercise system

### Goals

Expand beyond word-form exercises with new interactive exercise types.

### Deliverables

- **Translation exercises** - Greek ↔ English/Russian with multiple choice and text input
- **Flashcard system** - Spaced repetition for vocabulary memorization
- **Multiple choice tests** - Grammar and vocabulary with randomized options
- **Exercise statistics** - Detailed progress tracking and analytics
- **Difficulty adaptation** - Dynamic difficulty based on user performance

### Technical considerations

- Extend exercise type system with new adapters
- Implement spaced repetition algorithm (SM-2 or similar)
- Add progress persistence with IndexedDB
- Create exercise result analytics dashboard
- Maintain test coverage for all new exercise types

**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks
**Coverage requirement:** Maintain 93%+ for all new modules

## Phase 8 - Exercise creation tools

### Goals

Enable users and educators to create custom exercises.

### Deliverables

- **Exercise builder UI** - Visual editor for creating new exercises
- **JSON schema validation** - Runtime validation for user-created content
- **Exercise preview** - Live preview during creation process
- **Import/Export system** - Package exercises for sharing
- **Template library** - Pre-built exercise templates

### Architecture patterns

- Form handling with React Hook Form + Valibot
- Real-time JSON validation with error highlighting
- File handling for exercise packages
- Template system with composition patterns
- Undo/redo functionality for complex editing

**Timeline:** 8-10 weeks
**Target:** Support all current exercise types in builder

## Phase 9 - Social & sharing features

### Goals

Add community features and content sharing capabilities.

### Deliverables

- **URL sharing** - Share individual exercises via generated URLs
- **Exercise collections** - Group related exercises into learning paths
- **Community library** - Browse and use community-created exercises
- **Progress sharing** - Share achievements and statistics
- **Collaborative features** - Comments and ratings on exercises

### Technical requirements

- URL state management for shareable exercise links
- Community content moderation system
- User-generated content storage strategy
- Social authentication integration
- Real-time collaboration features (optional)

**Timeline:** 10-12 weeks
**Consideration:** May require backend services

## Phase 10 - Mobile optimization & PWA completion

### Goals

Complete PWA implementation with full offline support and mobile optimization.

### Deliverables

- **Full offline support** - Complete app functionality without network
- **Background sync** - Progress synchronization when connection resumes
- **Push notifications** - Learning reminders and progress updates
- **Mobile-first UX** - Touch interactions and responsive design refinements
- **App store deployment** - PWA distribution via app stores

### Technical implementation

- Advanced service worker strategies
- Background sync with retry policies
- Web Push API integration
- Touch gesture handling improvements
- App store optimization and metadata

**Timeline:** 6-8 weeks
**Target platforms:** iOS, Android via PWA, web app stores

## Long-term vision (Phase 11+)

### Platform expansion

- **Multi-language support** - Extend beyond Greek to other languages
- **Teacher dashboard** - Classroom management and student progress tracking
- **API ecosystem** - Public API for third-party integrations
- **Advanced analytics** - Learning pattern analysis and recommendations

### Technical evolution

- **Micro-frontend architecture** - Scale to multiple language modules
- **Real-time collaboration** - Shared learning sessions and classrooms
- **AI integration** - Intelligent exercise generation and personalization
- **Voice recognition** - Pronunciation practice and feedback

## Quality standards

### Non-negotiable requirements

- **Test coverage:** Maintain 93%+ for all new features
- **Performance budgets:** No bundle size regressions
- **Accessibility:** WCAG AA compliance for all features
- **Documentation:** Update guides alongside feature development
- **i18n compliance:** All UI text through translation system

### CI/CD requirements

- All phases must pass `pnpm validate`
- Bundle analysis integration
- Accessibility testing automation
- Cross-browser compatibility verification
- Security audit compliance

## Risk management

### Technical risks

- **Bundle size growth** - Monitor via automated analysis and budgets
- **Performance regressions** - Lighthouse CI integration
- **Testing complexity** - Maintain deterministic test patterns
- **Browser compatibility** - Target modern browsers, graceful degradation

### Mitigation strategies

- Phase-by-phase delivery to limit scope
- Feature flags for experimental functionality
- Rollback strategies for performance issues
- Community feedback integration
